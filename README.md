# Recipe_Saver
Recipe scraper for SeriousEats
This is a basic web scraping program to save recipes to a word document using a url address. Currently, this program is set up to save directly to a folder on my computer, so it would need to be edited for personal use. The libraries used are Beautiful Soup 4, docx, urllib, io, and Requests.
